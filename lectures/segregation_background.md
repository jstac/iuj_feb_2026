# Racial Segregation 

## Overview

Residential racial segregation is one of the most persistent features of many
urban landscapes. 

For example, despite the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and subsequent
fair housing legislation, American cities remain highly segregated by race.

This lecture provides background on the phenomenon of racial segregation in US
cities, setting the stage for our study of the Schelling segregation model.

## Visualizing Segregation

The maps below show the racial composition of several major US cities, based on
census data. 

Each dot represents a group of residents.

These maps reveal striking patterns of spatial separation between racial groups.

The maps shown below are from the
[Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service](https://demographics.coopercenter.org/)
at the University of Virginia.

### Columbus, Ohio

Racial distribution in Columbus, Ohio. The eastern portion of the city is
predominantly Black, while the surrounding areas are predominantly White.

### Memphis, Tennessee

Racial distribution in Memphis, Tennessee.

### Washington, D.C.

```{figure} _static/fig/washington_dc.webp
:name: dc_map
:width: 80%

Racial distribution in Washington, D.C. The 
the eastern portions of the city and Prince George's County
are predominantly Black, while the western suburbs in Virginia and Montgomery
County are predominantly White.
```

### Houston, Texas

```{figure} _static/fig/houston.webp

Racial distribution in Houston, Texas. Houston is one of America's most diverse cities.
Even so, clear clustering by race is evident.

### Miami, Florida

```{figure} _static/fig/miami.webp

Racial distribution in Miami, Florida. Miami illustrates three-way segregation:
Hispanic residents (orange) dominate the western and southern portions of the
metro area, Black residents (blue) are concentrated in the central-northern
areas, and White residents (red) cluster along the eastern coastal strip and
Miami Beach.

## The Social Impacts of Segregation

Racial residential segregation has significant consequences across many dimensions of life.


### Educational Inequality

Because public schools in the United States are typically funded by local
property taxes and students attend schools near their homes, residential
segregation leads directly to school segregation. 

Schools in predominantly minority neighborhoods often have:

- Lower per-pupil funding
- Less experienced teachers
- Fewer advanced course offerings
- Older facilities and fewer resources

These disparities contribute to persistent gaps in educational achievement and
attainment between racial groups.


### Economic Opportunity

Segregated neighborhoods affect economic mobility through several channels:

- **Job access**: Some minority neighborhoods are located far from major
  employment centers, creating spatial mismatch between workers and jobs.
- **Network effects**: Social networks tend to be geographically concentrated,
  so residents of segregated areas have fewer connections to job opportunities
  in other parts of the metropolitan area.
- **Wealth accumulation**: Housing is the primary source of wealth for most
  American families. Homes in predominantly minority neighborhoods have
  historically appreciated more slowly than comparable homes in White
  neighborhoods, limiting wealth accumulation.

### Health Disparities

Residential segregation contributes to racial health disparities through:

- **Environmental exposure**: Minority neighborhoods are more likely to be
  located near pollution sources, highways, and industrial facilities.
- **Food access**: Segregated minority neighborhoods often lack full-service
  grocery stores. 
- **Healthcare access**: These areas often have fewer healthcare providers and
  longer travel times to hospitals.

### Political Representation

Geographic concentration of minority populations can affect political power:

- Gerrymandering can exploit segregated housing patterns to dilute minority
  voting power.
- At the same time, concentration can sometimes create majority-minority
  districts that guarantee some minority representation.


### Social Cohesion

Segregation limits interracial contact and understanding:

- Residents of highly segregated areas have fewer opportunities to interact
  with people of other races in daily life.
- This can perpetuate stereotypes, reduce empathy, and make it harder to build
  broad coalitions for addressing common problems.
- Research suggests that interracial contact, particularly among children,
  reduces prejudice and improves intergroup relations.


## The Puzzle

Looking at these maps, one might assume that segregation persists because of
strong preferences---that people simply want to live only with others of
their own race.

But is this actually the case?

In the next lecture, we will study Thomas Schelling's segregation model,
which demonstrates a surprising result: extreme segregation can emerge even
when individuals have only mild preferences for same-race neighbors.

This insight has profound implications for understanding how segregation
persists and what policies might effectively address it.
