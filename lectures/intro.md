# Schelling Model Workshop

This workshop explores Thomas Schelling's segregation model and demonstrates how to accelerate the simulation using modern Python tools.

## Overview

The Schelling segregation model shows how mild individual preferences can lead to extreme aggregate outcomes. We study:

1. **The basic model** — Understanding the dynamics of racial segregation using Python classes
2. **NumPy implementation** — Rewriting the model with arrays and functions for clarity and speed
3. **JAX implementation** — Translating the model to JAX syntax and concepts

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming
- Familiarity with NumPy
- Understanding of agent-based models (helpful but not required)
